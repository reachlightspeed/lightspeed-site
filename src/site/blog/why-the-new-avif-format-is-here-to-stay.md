# Coming Soon: The AV1 Image File Format (.avif)
One of the upcoming technologies we're really excited about is the AV1 (.avif) image file format. It's basically a super-compressed image file. On their engineering blogs, [Facebook](https://engineering.fb.com/video-engineering/av1-beats-x264-and-libvpx-vp9-in-practical-use-case/) and [Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com/avif-for-next-generation-image-coding-b1d75675fe4 "AVIF for Next-Generation Image Coding") are already considering .avif superior to the JPEG, PNG, and even the newer WebP image formats for its image quality to compressed file size ratio.

The format was developed in a collaboration with Google, Cisco, and Xiph.org (who worked with Mozilla, creators of the Firefox browser). This format was created to be an open-sourced and royalty-free image format (unlike JPEG XR, which is a file format that compresses down very small but requires expensive licensing to implement).

## "Mobile first" means performance first
As mobile devices continue to grow in market share for devices which consumers regularly use to access the internet, organizations should think about page-load time for mobile devices &mdash; and not just those on Wi-Fi. Keeping your page as small as possible and only requesting the assets that you need benefits all visitors and espeically those on cellular connections. 

As consumers continue to shift more towards mobile devices, organizations will need to invest in performance to remain competitive. 

Some key findings from the study:

> **Based on a mobile site speed improvement of just 1/10th of a second, they found:** 
> * Mobile site speed improvements had a direct correlation to improved funnel progression.
> * A positive change in the number of page views, conversion rates and average order value across all verticals.
> * Retail conversions increased by 8.4% and average order value increased by 9.2%.
> * Travel conversions increased by 10.1% and average order value increased by 1.9%.
> * Luxury brand page views per session increased by 8.6%.
> * Lead generation information pages bounce rate improved by 8.3%
